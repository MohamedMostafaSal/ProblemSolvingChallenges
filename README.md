# ProblemSolvingChallenges
Some problem solving challenges that I tackled. 


1- The 10 word guessing challenge:

      Alice and Bob play the following game:
      Alice chooses a 10-letter word from a fixed dictionary, uniformly at random
      At each turn Bob proposes a word from the same dictionary
      For each proposal, Alice returns the "score" of the proposed word: each correct letter gives 1 point, plus an additional point if it is at the right position.
      The total score of Bob is the sum of scores over k rounds with k fixed to 5, 10 or 15.
      The goal is to maximize the score of Bob over 100 games - where each game lasts k rounds - (or its expectation). The score is then normalized so that the maximum score is 100.
